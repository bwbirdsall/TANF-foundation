        F1 is one of those sports I wish I knew more about, but have no real easy way of educating myself on and exposing myself to as a west-coast American. Everything I've seen of it looks to be a fascinating intersection of engineering brinksmanship and driving skill. This video walks through the evolution of the F1 car, in a stylized but informative way.

        <h3>Exploit of 2011: Brandon Roy Goes Supernova</h3>
        <blockquote>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br /><br />-Dylan Thomas, "Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night"</blockquote>The Exploit of the Year is ultimately a celebration of the best story. To pick the greatest actual achievement would require accurately weighing the irreducibly complex, interrelated and opaque interplay of cause and effect; the combination of effort and error, tactics and techne, physics and physiques that actually determines a contest. Instead, we tell stories. And no story this year could touch Brandon Roy's fourth quarter evisceration of the Mavericks in game four of the Trail Blazers-Mavericks first round playoff series.<br /><br />
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/pJjeZ4Scm9E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <br /><br />
        The bare fact of the comeback is enough to make it an Exploit contender: only <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MI3sj3XKrQ">one team</a> has ever come back from a bigger deficit in the fourth quarter of a playoff game, after all.  But what's most striking is just how single-handed it was. Really: with the exception of one Andre Miller 13-footer, Brandon Roy scored or assisted on literally every single point the Blazers scored in the fourth quarter. And who contested Terry's potential game-winner at the buzzer? For a straight half-hour, he fought in the face of overwhelming odds and a year of crumpled dreams<sup>1</sup> and then, with the crowd worked to a fervid state of awe and gratitude and desperate, ecstatic yearning,<sup>2</sup> iced a four-point play to tie the game. It was fucking <a href="http://www.blazersedge.com/2011/4/23/2129442/game-4-euphoria-thread-mavs-82-blazers-84">effulgent</a> and, even in the moment, the game-winning bank seemed a foregone conclusion.<blockquote><small>1: So "despair" is a pretty huge reach in English, but the French term "desespoir", or "dis-hope", seems kind of a propos.<br />2:  The Rose Garden is a place especially convinced of magical thinking, and not without reason. From the infancy of the franchise, the Blazers have had raucus crowds and outstanding home/away splits. The crowd believes deeply in the power of its heavy din to influence the game, to wear on opponents and buoy the Blazers through sheer faith and volume. The atmosphere affects the players' spirits, the thinking goes, which affects their effort, which affects the game. The feeling is not rational, but there's a grain of truth to it, and the amplified emotion of the crowd is contagious, even through a TV set.<sup>3</sup> <br />3: If you get the chance, watch a game there live. It will almost certainly be good; it might be a good deal better than that. I was lucky enough to see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-69V0tor960">this game</a> live-- I don't reckon I'll forget it anytime soon.</small></blockquote>Game four was the last game Brandon Roy will ever win. He announced his retirement from professional basketball on December 10th, 2011. Like Coleridge's <i>Kubla Khan</i>, Roy's career is brilliant but incomplete, forever haunted by what is missing. The open questions leave a lot of room for myth, but they have certainly robbed him of money and glory, and possibly championships and a spot in the Hall of Fame. It is real and it is tragic. But for all that, it is beautiful, and it's a hell of a story. Maybe we should just let him have the last word:<br /><br /><iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/rIMMo1Lt5xc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

      Sporting droughts are funny things. They appear gradually, organically, and each accretion of failures develops its own peculiar character. Some span generations of fans raised amidst the cyclical ruins of expectations, whole communities exchanging shibboleths of hope and despair. A drought's character develops contextually: losing longer than anyone else is harsh and heavy, but losing three consecutive Super Bowls is far more interesting.
      <br /><br />
      Coming into this year's Rugby World Cup, New Zealand's national side, the All Blacks, hadn't won it all in 24 years. That doesn't necessarily seem like a long time: the Red Sox waited 60 years longer than that before winning the World Series in '04; Portland has been waiting 34 years and counting for a second NBA title; England hasn't won a FIFA World cup in 45 years; Cleveland is still Cleveland, and looks to remain so for the foreseeable future. But in rugby, New Zealand is no Cleveland. The All Blacks win about 75% of all their matches. They are international rugby's leading point scorers of all time. They have a winning record and scoring margin over every test team they have ever faced.<sup>1</sup> They have held the world #1 ranking longer than every other country combined. It's like the USA Basketball team going 24 years without winning Olympic gold, if it were also by far the most popular team in all of American sports.
      <blockquote><small>1: Of those 20 teams, only 10 have even taken a single match.</small></blockquote>
      <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/abraham-james/2125497258/" title="rugby posts by jabrah15, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2330/2125497258_f85c804219.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="rugby posts"></a>
      <br /><br />
      See, nobody but nobody loves rugby like New Zealand.<sup>2</sup> With a population the size of metropolitan Phoenix, it supports the ITM Cup, a 14-team domestic professional championship, and five Super 15 franchises. There are 520 registered rugby clubs and 2,309 registered referees. The inaugural Rugby World Cup was co-hosted and won by New Zealand. They haven't won since<sup>3</sup> I was for a time a preschool teacher in Wellington, NZ: I watched toddlers fight over who got to play Richie McCaw and Dan Carter; I read them <a href="http://www.wheelers.co.nz/books/9780143503200-a-is-for-all-black/">"A is for All Black"</a>. So when the 2011 edition of the RWC returned to New Zealand, it's hard to overstate what a storm was stirred inside the bell jar.
      <blockquote><small>2: Some Welsh will get indignant at this claim: ignore them.<br />3: They came closest in '95, as popularized by the movie <i>Invictus</i>. Not mentioned in the film was New Zealand's team-wide bout of food poisoning right before the finals. They still made it into overtime.</small></blockquote>
      The All Blacks dominated the World Cup's early matches, winning their matches by an average of 38 points.<sup>4</sup> Their closest score coming into the Finals was a 20-6 dismantling of Australia's Wallabies in the semis. They had already beaten France by 20 points in pool play. But France has always handled the All Blacks better than most anyone. Two of the All Blacks' five RWC defeats came at the hands of Les Bleus, after all. From the start, France rose to the occasion, handling the haka<sup>5</sup> with balls<sup>7</sup> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1zysGOqqYM">poise</a>.
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/kjVqZkDZrgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <blockquote><small>4: To be fair, this is somewhat distorted by their surreal dominance over Canada (79-15) and Japan (83-7). If that means nothing to you, transpose that onto American football: the two sports score on about the same scale.<br />5: The haka, a traditional Maori war dance with which the All Blacks begin every match, has got to be the most spectacular pre-match ritual around. Warriors traditionally performed a haka before battle to pump themselves up and intimidate the opposition. There are a variety of lyrics,<sup>6</sup> but the All Blacks have settled on a short rotation of two. Note the face with the flared eyes (pūkana) and protuberant tongue: it originally developed as a heads up that that person intended, imminently and literally, to eat your dead body. That face is not fucking around.<br />6: Including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4o2bLb9f_E">this</a> astonishingly graceless bit of cultural appropriation.<br />7: Non-gendered balls, of course.</small></blockquote>
      The game itself was an exquisitely tense, low-scoring affair, with every kick and tackle and shift in advantage amplified by an incredibly loud, passionate crowd.<sup>8</sup> Honestly, the rugby wasn't that amazing per se; I mean, Piri Weepu had to be subbed out in the 49th minute because he couldn't find the uprights with a map. But whatever the play lacked in execution was completely overshadowed by its importance. The atmosphere was electric. Apologies for the cliché, but it's the correct metaphor: like the bolt of a Van de Graaff generator, the game seemed liable to break in any direction at a moment's notice. And yet, by the end things had settled with remarkable diegetic clarity. The first half, the All Blacks pounded the ball in French territory, pressed in the scrums and forced a pressured French side into penalties; the second half, the French pounded the ball in kiwi territory, asserted control in the scrums, and drew penalties; each side scored one try and one kick and missed a pair of very makeable penalties.
      <blockquote><small>8: Seriously, that crowd. I watched a recording of the game after the fact and to my extreme fucking chagrin got hit by a spoiler beforehand, and it still gave me goosebumps at points.</small></blockquote>
      Afterwards, as a horn section played "I Vow to Thee My Country"<sup>9</sup> on loop, the Bleus' shell-shocked captain fielded magnanimous questions about his plucky loss with numb, polite disappointment and the All Blacks exulted and hugged it out. Transcribed, the celebration seems banal; the "weight of a nation" announcing trite; the interviews about getting "quite a large monkey off your backs" asinine. But the moment itself was goddamn effulgent, a screaming, singing, laughing outpouring of people smiling so hard their faces hurt. Time is relative, and this has been a long time coming.
      <blockquote><small>9: Set to the friggin' colossal theme from Holst's "Jupiter", this has got to be the most flat-out stirring piece there is. Honorable mention goes to the bassline of the Star-Spangled Banner. Why does anyone ever play it without it?</small></blockquote>
